## Description
This application includes responsive layout using Bootstrap gird system (containers, rows, and columns).  
I have also used Bootstrap sub-columns.
I have created three html pages (index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html).
responsive navbar will be a togglebar for small screens.

All images used in this application are resposive with the help of Bootstrap classes.
This application is following the structure of semantic HTML elements.


It is working correctly. 
This application is structured properly.
