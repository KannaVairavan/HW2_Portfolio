# Portfolio

## Description
This application includes responsive layout using Bootstrap gird system (containers, rows, and columns).  
I have also used Bootstrap sub-columns & sticky footer.
I have created three html pages (index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html).
responsive navbar will be a togglebar for small screens.
All images used in this application are resposive with the help of Bootstrap classes.
This application is following the structure of semantic HTML elements.
